// [[_machine_mech]]
// === [underline]#*Mechanism of the Machine*#

// [[_removal]]
// ==== *Removal of Dust using Air*
// To secure the cloth in place and prevent it from being carried away by the wind, lay it flat and affix it to the surface. Utilize an air blower by directing the airflow over the cloth, with the attached blower expelling air from the top onto the fabric. For smaller pieces of fabric, a 500W mini blower, priced at Rs 500, is an effective solution. Alternatively, a manual approach involves installing a high-speed fan within a pipe for a similar effect.

// [[_soap_and_water]]


// ==== Soap + Water Mechanism
// [[_fig1_isometric]]

// The fundamental concept behind this method is to ensure comprehensive cleaning by spreading the soap solution evenly on both sides of the fabric. To execute this, a soap solution is meticulously prepared above the targeted cloth. This solution with a predetermined ratio of soap to water facilitates effective cleansing. Employing a specialized nozzle mechanism, the soap solution is methodically sprinkled onto the fabric evenly in both directions making it more effective in removing dirt, stains. The end result comes out to be a thorough and uniform cleaning mechanism.

// [[_stains]]
// ===== *Stains*
// In our research on fabric stains encountered during the manufacturing process, we identified common culprits such as oil-based stains, dye, and rust stains. For tackling oil-based stains like grease and wax, we recommend using petroleum-based cleaning agents or robust detergents such as ABS. Paint stains can be effectively removed with turpentine or a detergent pretreatment. Rust stains, on the other hand, respond well to a combination of detergents and scrubbing. While vinegar can be used for stain removal, it may require more time, leading us to consider alternative solutions. For oil stains, a mixture of 50% water and 50% white vinegar, along with a hot water detergent solution, proves effective. Spot cleaning for odors and stains can be achieved using a solution of white vinegar and water or a paste of baking soda and water. Bleaching, if needed, can be accomplished with bleaching powder, although caution is advised to prevent potential damage to the fabric fibers. Our comprehensive approach addresses various stains, providing practical solutions for effective cloth cleaning in the manufacturing process.

// [[_solvents]]
// ===== *Solvents*
// In our exploration of stain removal methods, we categorized stains into organic and inorganic types. Organic stains, such as those absorbed from lubricating oil, dyes, grease, and tannin, respond well to organic solvents. These solvents, such as ABS , effectively target and break down organic compounds, making them suitable for various manufacturing stains. On the other hand, inorganic stains, including adsorbed substances like muddy soil, inorganic salts, and contaminants, require a different approach. For these stains, the use of non-polar and volatile solvents is recommended, ensuring efficient removal without leaving residues. Additionally, high-pressure jet machines prove effective in the scouring process, providing a thorough cleaning method for a range of stains. This comprehensive strategy incorporates specialized solvents and techniques tailored to address the diverse nature of stains encountered in the manufacturing of fabrics.

// [[_scrubbing]]
// ==== *Scrubbing*
// For a washing machine assembly line, we've prioritized effective scrubbing for optimal cloth cleaning. Recognizing the fabric's thickness, we've implemented a two-step scrubbing approach. As the cloth advances between the conveyor belts, a circular scrubber is strategically positioned to vigorously scrub one side. To enhance the scrubbing effectiveness, we've incorporated a rough platform opposite to the scrub, acting like a 'washboard' for improved friction and cleaning. This meticulous scrubbing process is crucial, as without the platform, the scrubbing efficiency is compromised. After cleaning one side, we reverse the positions of the scrubber and platform to ensure a thorough scrubbing action on the other side. Our design emphasizes the importance of robust scrubbing for a comprehensive and efficient cleaning process on the assembly line.

// [[_water_mech]]
// ==== *Water Mechanism*
// The scrubbed fabric retaining traces of soap, undergoes exposure to high-pressure water from a nozzle. Subsequently, the cloth is guided through a wiper to eliminate any surplus moisture and soap solution. The combined unit, comprising both the nozzle and wiper, moves back and forth across the fabric for several iterations, with the exact number determined during the testing phase.

// [[_drying]]
// ==== Drying
// The device produces warm air directed towards damp surfaces using a hot air-drying method. The same mechanism can be understood as the one used in a hair dryer.  This targeted application of heat speeds up the evaporation process of water molecules. The elevated temperature boosts the energy of the water, facilitating its swift transition from liquid to vapor. This mechanism effectively eliminates moisture, making it a fast and efficient technique for drying fabrics.

=== Overview

We propose the development of an innovative cloth cleaning machine that can be used to clean oil stains (which occur near the edges) off of manufactured cloth after the manufacturing process. Our design consists of rollers, driving motors, a guiding frame (used to fold the cloth in half vertically), wiping and cleaning surfaces (brushes/sponge), a soap water mixture compartment, a water compartment, and a drying chamber. This automated system aims to streamline the cloth manufacturing process, ensuring efficient cleaning and drying during the manufacturing process while minimising the impact on the fabric. The USP of our design is that the regions of the cloth that are guaranteed to come in clean are untouched in the process, which preserves the quality and durability of the cloth. This approach also ensures that drying requires less effort and resources than other approaches.

==== Key Components:
===== Rollers with Motor Control:
* Two rollers placed on either side of the machine.
* Motor-controlled to regulate the speed of the cloth movement.

===== Cloth Attachment:
* Cloth is securely attached to the rollers upon loading in batches, ensuring uniform tension.

===== Guiding Frame:
* Positioned between the rollers upon viewing from the side and placed parallelly between the two vertical walls when viewed from the top.
* The frame, when viewed from the side, looks like a smoothened plateau with a long flat top and curved sides (coming from and going towards the input and output rollers, respectively.) Upon viewing from the top, it looks like the edge of a railing. 
* The frame is slightly angled and is broader at the bottom than at the top. (This helps in dispensing soap on the edge stains from the top with targeted and precise positioning)
* All edges on the frame are filleted and smoothened to ensure that the cloth doesn’t rip or tear or get stuck while it slides over the frame due to the pull of the motor. (Please note, the top of the frame is not a dome kept on top of a rectangular sheet. It is a rectangular sheet that is cut to the guiding geometry and filleted and smoothened)
* It is shaped this way to guide the fabric to smoothly rise in height from the horizontal roller configuration at the input to the folded vertical configuration in the cleaning and drying chamber.
* This vertical folding ensures that the stained edges are hanging on the two sides of the frame symmetrically, with the entire cloth folded along the midline and suspended vertically by the normal reaction from the sleek frame.
* The part of the fabric towards the centre in the horizontal configuration, now slides at the top of the smooth frame as the rollers on the other end pulls it at a constant speed and is unaffected by the cleaning and drying process.
* Once the cloth crosses the drying chamber, the guiding frame is shaped in such a way that it lowers the cloth from the raised frame back to its horizontal configuration onto the roller

===== Cleaning Mechanism:
* Brushes along the edges of the frame at a fixed distance from the height (coincides with the stained edge of the cloth).
* The parallel wall also has brushes at the same vertical height, and the two brushes hold onto the edge of the cloth as it moves under the influence of the rollers and scrubs against the brushes, hence getting cleaned.
* Solvent drizzled from the top onto the stained part of the cloth). The solvent mixture and water are dispensed in succession and recursively, creating stages along the length of the frame. (first “x” cm-> soap, next “y” cm-> water, next “x” cm-> soap, etc. )
* Brushes act as scrubbers to enhance cleaning effectiveness.

===== Cleaning Fluid Compartment:
* Alternating compartments for soap water mixture and water.
* The soap compartments have brushes along the wall, while the water compartment consists of high pressure water nozzles to remove soap from the cloth. 
* Ensures proper cleaning of the cloth during the process.

===== Drying Chamber:
* Located after the cleaning mechanism.
* Equipped with air blowers to blow hot air onto the cloth.
* Ensures quick and effective drying.

===== Guiding Fixtures:
* Transition the cloth from the input roller to the cleaning chamber of the frame and from the drying chamber of the frame to the rollers.
* Facilitates a smooth movement of the cloth.

===== Waste Tub:
* A waste tub at the bottom to collect residual drippings and lint.

==== Workflow:
* Cloth is loaded onto input rollers over the guiding frame, through them and onto the output roller. (in order to prevent wastage of a significant initial length of the cloth roll, we can attach it to a clean dummy cloth as  long as the machine, with the help of a speed punching system and later detach the dummy cloth and reuse it for the next batch-This is not relevant to the demonstration but very relevant to during industrial scaling)
* Then a lever/switch is activated, which brings the two walls closer to the guiding frame with the cloth attached to it, and the horizontal line of brushes lock onto each hanging edge of the cloth, securing it in place.
* Motors are powered on, and the cloth starts sliding on the frame while being kept in place by the walls and guiding fixtures.
* Solvent is drizzled from the top with targeted precision on the edges, and brushes act as scrubbers for thorough cleaning as the cloth slides over them.
* The cloth passes through multiple alternating soap water mixture and water compartments and gets recursively cleaned for better results.
* The cloth then enters the drying chamber, where hot air is blown to expedite the drying process.
* After drying, the cleaned and dried cloth moves through guiding fixtures onto the rollers for subsequent manufacturing.

==== Benefits:
* Improved cloth cleaning efficiency.
* Minimised impact on the fabric during the cleaning process.
* Streamlined manufacturing workflow.
* Enhanced drying capabilities for increased production speed.
This innovative cloth making machine promises to revolutionise the textile industry by automating and optimising the cloth cleaning and drying processes.

==== Calculation of order of magnitude of the length of the chamber:
Suppose the cleaning and drying part of the machine is ‘l’ inches long.
The cloth needs to be in the cleaning environment for about 90 seconds to get cleaned and dried (experimental estimate using soap, hair dryer and napkin).

* Load in one batch = 11 kg
* Breadth of cloth roll = 2 m
* Areal density of Single ply cotton cloth unbleached, denier 60, thread count 400 = 0.180 kg/m^2^
* Time provided for cleaning = 45 minutes

[latexmath]
.*Calculation:*
++++
l = \frac{(90 * 11)}{(0.18 * 2 * 45 * 60)} = 1  m (approx) = 40 inches (approx)
++++

*Note*
Varying soaps changes the time cloth needs to spend in the chamber, which increases/decreases the length of the machine.

=== Component Analysis

==== Roller
... The roller will roll the washed cloth, coming through the conveyor belt.
... A controlled DC motor will be used to drive the roller.
... Appropriately select the dimensions of the roller, like the diameter of the roller and its length, based on the conveyor width.
... Choose a proper outer covering for the roller, which can provide a better grip and friction for the cloth.

The cloth will also be straightened using 1 or 2 uncontrolled rolling cylinders which can provide the requisite tension in the fabric and guide the fabric onto the roller.

===== [underline]#*Controlling DC motor using Arduino:*#
To control the speed of a DC motor using Arduino, we need to adjust the input voltage supplied to the motor. 
We can control the input voltage with a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal.
To change the speed of the DC motor we need to change the amplitude of the input voltage that is applied to the motor.
A common technique to do that is PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). In PWM the applied voltage is adjusted by sending a series of pulses so the output voltage is proportional pulse width generated by the microcontroller that is also known as *duty cycle*.

.Duty Cycle

The higher the duty cycle, the higher the average voltage applied to the DC motor (resulting in higher speed) and the shorter the duty cycle, the lower the average voltage applied to the DC motor (resulting in lower speed).

===== Arduino and L293D Circuit Diagram

A common and cheap solution to drive motors and efficiently control them, is to use a Motor Controller module along with Arduino. L293D Motor driver module is a readily available IC which can be easily interfaced with Arduino, to control the various aspects of DC motors like speed, direction and braking. It is designed to provide bidirectional drive currents of up to 600-mA at voltages from 4.5 V to 36V.
Below is an example of a circuit diagram to drive multiple motors from a single module, and Arduino code to interface a motor with the module.

** [underline]#Explanation:#
*** When the distance is less than 10cm we have to turn on the MOSFET and else we have to turn off the MOSFET. We will also use the on board LED connected to pin 13 and toggle it along with the MOSFET so that we can ensure if the MOSFET is in turned on or off state.
*** Inside the main loop function we call for the function called measure_distance(). This function uses the US sensor to measure the distance of the object in front of it and updates the value to the variable 'distance'. 
*** The input or the detection will send a sonic blast of Ultrasonic signals into the air which will get reflected by the object in front of it and the echo pin will pick up the signals reflected by it.
*** Then we use the time taken value to calculate the distance of the object ahead of the sensor. 
*** Once the distance is calculated, we have to compare the value of distance using a simple if statement and if the value is less than 10cm we make the MOSFET and LED to go high, in the following else statement we make the MOSFET and LED to go low

==== Dryer

We are planning to use the configuration of tunnel dryer to dry the clothes. The power and torque requirements of the motor used in blower and power requirements of the heater will depend on the time needed to dry the cloth, rate at which the cloth is being fed, width and height of the chamber, final moisture content and initial moisture content.
Also, since counter current configuration is most efficient, we will be using the same in our design. Using tunnel dryers also allows us to move the conveyor belt slowly as it is very efficient in processing materials taking long drying time and thus requiring lesser motor drive.

image::https://github.com/naunidhsingh03/ELP305-TribeD-Resources/raw/9ae27957f7f9bed7b02f8cd5803453d164ba0f19/electrical_resources/tunnel_dryer.png[]

Optimization for power requirements will be done once design specs are provided and it would be based on the mathematical modelling and simulations done to observe the humidity content with rate of air flow and power input to heater and blower.
To control the heater we will use Arduino, a temperature sensor (thermocouple), a relay module, battery and bunch of connecting wires.
One of the circuits which can be used is as follows:

One can have LCD display to keep track of any errors in the functioning.
Arduino code for controlling heater is as follows:

==== Blower

* We will be controlling the speed of the DC motor using a potentiometer for the purpose of  blower in our washing machine to remove heavy dust particles from the cloth piece. 
* Potentiometer has three terminals. Outer two terminals are for power supply and the middle terminal is the output.
* As we rotate the knob of the potentiometer, the resistance between the middle terminal and one of the outer terminals changes. This change in resistance controls the voltage supplied to the motor, which in turn controls its speed.
* We can connect multiple DC motors in our system by making slight modifications in the wiring.
* A Transistor is used for more efficient control of the motor speed. By controlling the current flow to the motor, transistors can prevent overloading and overheating, enhancing the motor’s lifespan.

[[_ABS_meaning]]
ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene):: A strong and durable thermoplastic polymer used in manufacturing. 
Affix:: Securely attach or fasten.  
CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board):: A regulatory body in India that sets standards for environmental pollution control.  
Denier:: A unit of measurement for the linear mass density of fibers. It is the mass in grams per 9000 meters of the fiber.  
Desizing:: The removal of sizing agents, such as starch or other chemicals, from fabrics to prepare them for further processing.  
Gantt Chart:: A visual representation of a project schedule that shows the start and finish dates of various elements of the project.  
Graywater:: Domestic wastewater that does not contain fecal matter, often reused for irrigation or other non-potable purposes.  
Isometric View:: A three-dimensional representation of an object, showing all three spatial dimensions in one view.  
Mercerizing:: A textile finishing process that increases the luster and strength of fabric, typically cotton, by treating it with a caustic soda solution. 
Nozzle:: A device for controlling the direction or flow of a fluid. 
Nozzle mechanism:: The nozzle and flapper mechanism are a displacement type detector which converts mechanical movement into a pressure signal by covering the opening of a nozzle with a flat plate called the flapper. This restricts fluid flow through the nozzle and generates a pressure signal. 
Petroleum-based cleaning agents:: Solvents effective for oil-based stains (e.g., mineral spirits, naphtha).
Pretreatment:: Applying cleansing agent before washing.  
Resource Breakdown:: A breakdown of resources required for a project, often detailing labor, equipment, and materials.
