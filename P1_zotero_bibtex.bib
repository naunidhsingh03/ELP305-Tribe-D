00:00 Introduction

Thanks to the Laundry Evangelist's Laundry Camp for many of the tips shown in this video. If you ever have the chance to visit it at the Mall of America, you should do so.

No matter how careful a man may be in his day-to-day life with his clothes, the occasional stain is inevitable whether it be from a plate of spaghetti and impromptu tire change on the side of the road or really any time spent with a toddler, you're bound to encounter a tough stain at some point. Fortunately, however, stain removal doesn't have to be a chore or involve the dry cleaner. As long as you understand some basic chemistry you'll be all set. 

01:10 Four Basic Types Of Stains
Stains can be organic or inorganic in nature and from there can be oily or not. In other words, the four types of stains are organic, inorganic, oily organic, and oily inorganic. As examples of each of these, stains from living organisms including plants are considered organic, things like grass stains, blood, or red wine. Meanwhile, stains from manmade materials are inorganic, things like ink, solvents, or machine dust. Oily organics are things like barbecue sauce or sweat stains and oily inorganics are generally cosmetics like lipstick. 

02:15 How To Get Rid Of Stains
First, standard organic stains are best treated with hot water and a substance that's commonly marketed as bleach alternative. Bleach alternative and oxygen bleach are marketing names for a substance that's scientifically known as sodium percarbonate or SPC for short. It's the active ingredient in cleaners like Oxiclean but whereas those types of commercial cleaners usually contain fillers, SPC is most effective in its pure form.

For treatment of an organic stain, start by laying a towel down on your work surface. Actually, for any of the types of stains, we're about to cover, putting down a clean towel is a good idea. Next, add a bit of SPC, we used about 1/2 capful to a basin of hot water and stir to completely dissolve it. Then, thoroughly wet the stained area of the garment in question with the hot water and SPC mixture. Lay the garment flat on the towel and gently blot at the stain with a clean cotton cloth, washcloth, or towel. You can also use a garment safe stain brush on most fabrics as we're doing here. After pre-treating your stain this way, it can be washed as normal in your machine and if you'd like, you can also add a bit more SPC directly to the drum of the machine during the wash process. 

Next, standard inorganic stains like ink are best removed by the use of a solvent. Rubbing alcohol or more technically isopropyl alcohol is best here. Although you can also use different substances like plain vodka. Applying the alcohol to the stain with a spray bottle works well after which point it can be gently blotted. Then wash as normal and as before, you can add some SPC to the machine if you'd like. 

All oily stains whether they're organic or inorganic in nature are best treated by first dealing with the oil. As oils often surround other staining substances, we'll be looking at these stains sort of like a stain sandwich that is oil layer, stain layer, oil layer. To remove the first oil layer, fill a spray bottle with a solution of 50 percent white vinegar and 50 percent water. Spray the oil layer of the stain and then blot. Actually, using a stain brush may work best here. Next, apply a bit of water along with laundry detergent or better yet soap flakes and scrub again to deal with the main stain layer and for the final oil layer, spray again with your water and vinegar solution and blot or scrub a final time. To finish here, you guessed it! Wash as normal with optional SPC.},

This project explores the tools used for washing clothing and provides insight into the lives of the individuals who used them, and how the evolution of these tools changed their way of life. Using a method based on the works of Jules David Prown, an interpretive analysis is being completed for multiple artifacts selected from the Idaho State Historical Society’s collection. The steps of this method include a thorough description of the artifact, making deductions about the artifact based on the description, as well as creating and testing hypotheses about what the artifact signifies. In addition to focusing on the specific artifacts, advertisements for these items are being analyzed to determine how these products were marketed to these women; this will assist in determining the comfort levels individuals had with newer methods of washing, and reveal the proposed benefits of transitioning to new machinery. The overall purpose of this research is to ignite an interest in the history of domestic women, as well as promote the preservation of the artifacts they used on a regular basis.},

Experiments of outdoor cloth drying are investigated as a benchmark. It is found drying duration is about 2-3 hours for satisfactory drying states under sunny weather. To reduce drying period, the mass transport coefficient is the highest sensitive factor while it can be adjusted by air speed through clothes. Experimental results of a rapid cloth drying heat pump show that the drying period can be reduced to 12 minutes with COP of 5.4. This understanding is able to strengthen development of rapid cloth drying for technological innovation.},

The main goal of this work was to investigate the behaviour of knitted fabric during drying at different conditions, and the influence of these conditions on finished knitwear dimensional stability. The samples were knitted on a circular single face and interlock knitting machines from cotton yarns and their combination with PES yarns. Special method of knitted fabric drying was developed for the experimental testing. Thus industrial drying of knitted fabrics was simulated in experimental conditions. The samples were dried in six different modes: hanged on a line in course and wale directions, spread on a smooth surface, winded by hot air, spread on a heated surface, and in a tumbler-dryer. Shrinkage potential of knitwear samples dried in different conditions was determined. After that samples were washed and dried in domestic conditions. Then it was determined how much drying conditions in finishing process influence knitwear's shrinkage potential and dimensional stability during its exploitation.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of laundering on the shrinkage and elasticity of cotton/spandex fabrics, in which one group was enhanced 5\%, the other group was 10\%, the third group was 15\% during tentering and the final group was not enhanced but dyed with a reactive dye. The laundering conditions were varied in washing temperature, drying methods and number of wash cycles. Shrinkage and elasticity as the extension and elastic recovery after stretching at a force of 15 N for cotton/spandex fabrics were investigated. The fabrics which were treated with greater enhancing during tentering, showed greater shrinkage, lower extension and less elastic recovery after repeated washings and dryings. The cotton/spandex fabric which was enhanced 5\% during tentering showed the least amount of deformation after 20 washings. The greatest deformation of the cotton/spandex fabrics occurred after the first wash, but the increases in shrinkage and elasticity were reduced as the number of wash cycles increased. The fabrics which were washed at {\textless}TEX{\textgreater}\$20{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}C\${\textless}/TEX{\textgreater} and air dried showed lower shrinkage and lower extension with the force of 15 N than the fabrics washed at {\textless}TEX{\textgreater}\$40{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}C\${\textless}/TEX{\textgreater} and dried in the tumble dryer. This showed that drying temperatures had a greater affect on the deformation of the cotton/spandex fabrics than the washing temperatures.},

	abstract = {It is important to understand the characteristics of hot-air drying of cotton fabrics for the structure design and process optimization of the drying equipment. A transient heat and moisture transfer model of the thin porous cotton fabric is established, in which the uneven heating on the textile surface caused by the hot air jet was considered. The effects of environmental air temperature and relative humidity, initial moisture content, hot air temperature, and velocity at the nozzle outlet on the drying characters were studied via this model. Results show that the temperature of the constant rate drying period at various points on the fabric is different due to the uneven heat input, which is higher at the center part of the fabric and lower away from the center of the fabric. The drying time is very non-uniform on the fabric surface especially when the hot air for drying and the environmental air have a large temperature difference. The environmental air humidity also has great influence on the drying time. The drying time of fabric increases by more than two times as the environmental air humidity rises from 5\% to 30\%. During the drying process, increasing hot air temperature is more conducive to improve the drying efficiency than increasing hot air velocity. The drying time decreases 19\% only when the hot air velocity doubled, meaning that increasing hot air velocity cannot improve drying rate effectively. Moreover, experiments were conducted and results show that the experimental results coincided with the simulated ones well.},
