### 2.6 Abstract

_This project revolves around developing a user-centric washing machine, which involves a comprehensive analysis of the features an average user looks for. Through extensive research, we will identify key elements that resonate with the needs and preferences of the general population when searching for a washing machine._
*Our initial design focuses on building a basic model, which in further iterations can incorporate more advanced features as a result of extensive surveys and research done across the course of the project to satisfy the contemporary users' needs.*

### 2.7. Motivation

Our goal with this project is to create an advanced fabric-cleaning machine designed to wash oil stains, specifically those near the edges of manufactured cloth. This machine aims to improve the efficiency of cloth manufacturing by providing effective drying and cleaning processes while preserving the fabric. Our design’s USP is its ability to leave the areas of the cloth that are already clean untouched, which preserves the fabric’s quality and durability. Utilizing this approach helps ensure a straightforward process and reduces the resources required for drying. We currently have an Autodesk model of our machine and have researched various electrical parts and how they will be implemented practically. We have also tested various solvents in an attempt to find one which is most suitable. Finally, we intend to deliver a working model of this machine, which focuses on cleaning oil and grease stains left in cloth during the manufacturing process while focusing more on the edges of the cloth as there are higher chances of deterioration on the periphery.

## 2.9. Overview

We propose the development of an innovative cloth cleaning machine that can be used to clean oil stains (which occur near the edges) off of manufactured cloth after the manufacturing process. Our design consists of rollers, driving motors, a guiding frame (used to fold the cloth in half vertically), wiping and cleaning surfaces (brushes/sponge), a soap water mixture compartment, a water compartment, and a drying chamber. This automated system aims to streamline the cloth manufacturing process, ensuring efficient cleaning and drying during the manufacturing process while minimizing the impact on the fabric. The USP of our design is that the regions of the cloth that are guaranteed to come in clean are untouched in the process, which preserves the quality and durability of the cloth. This approach also ensures that drying requires less effort and resources than other approaches.

### 2.9.1 Key Components:

#### Rollers with Motor Control:
- Two rollers placed on either side of the machine.
- Motor-controlled to regulate the speed of the cloth movement.

#### Cloth Attachment:
- Cloth is securely attached to the rollers upon loading in batches, ensuring uniform tension.

#### Guiding Frame:
- Positioned between the rollers upon viewing from the side and placed parallelly between the two vertical walls when viewed from the top.
- The frame, when viewed from the side, looks like a smoothened plateau with a long flat top and curved sides (coming from and going towards the input and output rollers, respectively.) Upon viewing from the top, it looks like the edge of a railing. 
- The frame is slightly angled and is broader at the bottom than at the top. (This helps in dispensing soap on the edge stains from the top with targeted and precise positioning)
- All edges on the frame are filleted and smoothened to ensure that the cloth doesn’t rip or tear or get stuck while it slides over the frame due to the pull of the motor. (Please note, the top of the frame is not a dome kept on top of a rectangular sheet. It is a rectangular sheet that is cut to the guiding geometry and filleted and smoothened)
- It is shaped this way to guide the fabric to smoothly rise in height from the horizontal roller configuration at the input to the folded vertical configuration in the cleaning and drying chamber.
- This vertical folding ensures that the stained edges are hanging on the two sides of the frame symmetrically, with the entire cloth folded along the midline and suspended vertically by the normal reaction from the sleek frame.
- The part of the fabric towards the centre in the horizontal configuration, now slides at the top of the smooth frame as the rollers on the other end pulls it at a constant speed and is unaffected by the cleaning and drying process.
- Once the cloth crosses the drying chamber, the guiding frame is shaped in such a way that it lowers the cloth from the raised frame back to its horizontal configuration onto the roller
#### Cleaning Mechanism:
- Brushes along the edges of the frame at a fixed distance from the height (coincides with the stained edge of the cloth).
- The parallel wall also has brushes at the same vertical height, and the two brushes hold onto the edge of the cloth as it moves under the influence of the rollers and scrubs against the brushes, hence getting cleaned.
- Solvent drizzled from the top onto the stained part of the cloth. The solvent mixture and water are dispensed in succession and recursively, creating stages along the length of the frame. (first “x” cm-> soap, next “y” cm-> water, next “x” cm-> soap, etc.)
- Brushes act as scrubbers to enhance cleaning effectiveness.

#### Cleaning Fluid Compartment:
- Alternating compartments for soap water mixture and water.
- The soap compartments have brushes along the wall, while the water compartment consists of high-pressure water nozzles to remove soap from the cloth.
- Ensures proper cleaning of the cloth during the process.

#### Drying Chamber:
- Located after the cleaning mechanism.
- Equipped with air blowers to blow hot air onto the cloth.
- Ensures quick and effective drying.

#### Guiding Fixtures:
- Transition the cloth from the input roller to the cleaning chamber of the frame and from the drying chamber of the frame to the rollers.
- Facilitates a smooth movement of the cloth.

#### Waste Tub:
- A waste tub at the bottom to collect residual drippings and lint.

### 2.9.2. Workflow:
- Cloth is loaded onto input rollers over the guiding frame, through them and onto the output roller. (in order to prevent wastage of a significant initial length of the cloth roll, we can attach it to a clean dummy cloth as long as the machine, with the help of a speed punching system and later detach the dummy cloth and reuse it for the next batch-This is not relevant to the demonstration but very relevant to during industrial scaling)
- Then a lever/switch is activated, which brings the two walls closer to the guiding frame with the cloth attached to it, and the horizontal line of brushes lock onto each hanging edge of the cloth, securing it in place.
- Motors are powered on, and the cloth starts sliding on the frame while being kept in place by the walls and guiding fixtures.
- Solvent is drizzled from the top with targeted precision on the edges, and brushes act as scrubbers for thorough cleaning as the cloth slides over them.
- The cloth passes through multiple alternating soap water mixture and water compartments and gets recursively cleaned for better results.
- The cloth then enters the drying chamber, where hot air is blown to expedite the drying process.
- After drying, the cleaned and dried cloth moves through guiding fixtures onto the rollers for subsequent manufacturing.

Figure 6: WorkFlow


### 2.9.3 Benefits:
- Improved cloth cleaning efficiency.
- Minimized impact on the fabric during the cleaning process.
- Streamlined manufacturing workflow.
- Enhanced drying capabilities for increased production speed.
This innovative cloth making machine promises to revolutionize the textile industry by automating and optimizing the cloth cleaning and drying processes.

### 2.9.4. Calculation of Order of Magnitude of the Length of the Chamber:

Suppose the cleaning and drying part of the machine is ‘l’ inches long. The cloth needs to be in the cleaning environment for about 90 seconds to get cleaned and dried (experimental estimate using soap, hair dryer and napkin).

- Load in one batch = 11 kg
- Breadth of cloth roll = 2 m
- Areal density of Single ply cotton cloth unbleached, denier 60, thread count 400 = 0.180 kg/m²
- Time provided for cleaning = 45 minutes

**Calculation:**

 $$ l = \frac{(90 \times 11)}{(0.18 \times 2 \times 45 \times 60)} = 1 \ \text{m} \ (\text{approx}) = 40 \ \text{inches} \ (\text{approx}) $$


*Note:*
Varying soaps changes the time cloth needs to spend in the chamber, which increases/decreases the length of the machine.

## 2.10. Component Analysis

### 2.10.1 Roller
- The roller will roll the washed cloth, coming through the conveyor belt.
- A controlled DC motor will be used to drive the roller.
- Appropriately select the dimensions of the roller, like the diameter of the roller and its length, based on the conveyor width.
- Choose a proper outer covering for the roller, which can provide a better grip and friction for the cloth.

The cloth will also be straightened using 1 or 2 uncontrolled rolling cylinders which can provide the requisite tension in the fabric and guide the fabric onto the roller.

#### Industrial Roller
![Industrial Roller](https://github.com/naunidhsingh03/ELP305-TribeD-Resources/raw/4657c2e45a7e58677d9d220eac84a0fc316f88ca/electrical_resources/Picture1.png)

Figure 7: Industrial Roller
#### *Controlling DC motor using Arduino:*
To control the speed of a DC motor using Arduino, we need to adjust the input voltage supplied to the motor. We can control the input voltage with a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal. To change the speed of the DC motor we need to change the amplitude of the input voltage that is applied to the motor. A common technique to do that is PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). In PWM the applied voltage is adjusted by sending a series of pulses so the output voltage is proportional pulse width generated by the microcontroller that is also known as *duty cycle*.
### Duty Cycle
![Duty Cycle](https://github.com/naunidhsingh03/ELP305-TribeD-Resources/raw/4c3f442d4cf538c5df98a55429b09d2a34c96f45/electrical_resources/duty_cycle.png)

Figure 8: Duty Cycle

The higher the duty cycle, the higher the average voltage applied to the DC motor (resulting in higher speed) and the shorter the duty cycle, the lower the average voltage applied to the DC motor (resulting in lower speed).

#### Arduino and L293D Circuit Diagram

A common and cheap solution to drive motors and efficiently control them is to use a Motor Controller module along with Arduino. L293D Motor driver module is a readily available IC which can be easily interfaced with Arduino to control the various aspects of DC motors like speed, direction, and braking. It is designed to provide bidirectional drive currents of up to 600-mA at voltages from 4.5 V to 36V.

Below is an example of a circuit diagram to drive multiple motors from a single module, and Arduino code to interface a motor with the module.

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(trigger, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(echo, INPUT);
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(MOSFET, OUTPUT);
  delay(2000);
}

void loop() {
  measure_distance();
  Serial.println(distance);
  
  if (distance < 10) {
    digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(MOSFET, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
    digitalWrite(MOSFET, LOW);
  }

}

void measure_distance() {

  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(trigger, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigger, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  time = pulseIn(echo, HIGH);
  distance = time * 340 / 20000;
}
```
* Explanation:
  * When the distance is less than 10cm we have to turn on the MOSFET and else we have to turn off the MOSFET. We will also use the on board LED connected to pin 13 and toggle it along with the MOSFET so that we can ensure if the MOSFET is in turned on or off state.
  * Inside the main loop function we call for the function called measure_distance(). This function uses the US sensor to measure the distance of the object in front of it and updates the value to the variable 'distance'.
  * The input or the detection will send a sonic blast of Ultrasonic signals into the air which will get reflected by the object in front of it and the echo pin will pick up the signals reflected by it.
  * Then we use the time taken value to calculate the distance of the object ahead of the sensor.
  * Once the distance is calculated, we have to compare the value of distance using a simple if statement and if the value is less than 10cm we make the MOSFET and LED to go high, in the following else statement we make the MOSFET and LED to go low.

### 2.10.4. Dryer
We are planning to use the configuration of tunnel dryer to dry the clothes. The power and torque requirements of the motor used in blower and power requirements of the heater will depend on the time needed to dry the cloth, rate at which the cloth is being fed, width and height of the chamber, final moisture content and initial moisture content. Also, since counter current configuration is most efficient, we will be using the same in our design. Using tunnel dryers also allows us to move the conveyor belt slowly as it is very efficient in processing materials taking long drying time and thus requiring lesser motor drive.
![](https://github.com/naunidhsingh03/ELP305-TribeD-Resources/raw/9ae27957f7f9bed7b02f8cd5803453d164ba0f19/electrical_resources/tunnel_dryer.png)
Figure 16: Tunnel Dryer

Optimization for power requirements will be done once design specs are provided and it would be based on the mathematical modelling and simulations done to observe the humidity content with rate of air flow and power input to heater and blower. To control the heater we will use Arduino, a temperature sensor (thermocouple), a relay module, battery and bunch of connecting wires. One of the circuits which can be used is as follows:
![](https://github.com/naunidhsingh03/ELP305-TribeD-Resources/raw/9ae27957f7f9bed7b02f8cd5803453d164ba0f19/electrical_resources/dryer_pic_2.png)
Figure 17: circuit for dryer

One can have LCD display to keep track of any errors in the functioning. Arduino code for controlling heater is as follows: link: code1

For running and controlling the blower we need to have an Arduino controlling motor, anemometer, battery and bunch of wires.

### 2.10.5. Blower
* We will be controlling the speed of the DC motor using a potentiometer for the purpose of blower in our washing machine to remove heavy dust particles from the cloth piece.
* Potentiometer has three terminals. Outer two terminals are for power supply and the middle terminal is the output.
* As we rotate the knob of the potentiometer, the resistance between the middle terminal and one of the outer terminals changes. This change in resistance controls the voltage supplied to the motor, which in turn controls its speed.
* We can connect multiple DC motors in our system by making slight modifications in the wiring.
* A Transistor is used for more efficient control of the motor speed. By controlling the current flow to the motor, transistors can prevent overloading and overheating, enhancing the motor’s lifespan.

## 2.11. Solvent

### 2.11.1. Lipase Enzyme
   * Pros: Lipase is an enzyme that breaks down oil and thus was thought of as a solution to clean oil and grease stains.
   * Cons: The idea was rejected as we require the water to be slightly warm(~40-50 C) for the optimal enzyme action, and maintaining warm water is not so easy.
   
### 2.11.2. Spot Remover(such as Shout) and Hot Water
  * Pros: It can remove both oil and grease stains. Spraying the stain remover and then followed by brushing in hot water can remove the results.
  * Cons: Increases the energy requirement of the model as hot water is required. Using spot removers increases the cost.

### 2.11.3. Spot Lifters(such as K2R spot lifter) followed by dry brushing
  * Pros: It overcomes the drawback of scrubbing in hot water(mentioned in the previous method). After application, keeping it for 10-15 minutes lifts the stain and only a brush off is required in the end.
  * Cons: It is very costly(~3300 Rs for 150 ml) and availability may become an issue when required in large amounts, as it is manufactured in the USA. 

### 2.11.4. Baby powder/ Cornstarch/ Salt/ Vinegar followed by washing
  * Pros: Effective in cleaning oil and grease stain significantly
  * Cons: Requires soaking and  multiple iterations to remove the stains, therefore time consuming





### 2.11.5. WD-40 or Lighter Fluid
* Pros: Effective in cleaning oil and grease stain significantly
* Cons: Takes 20 min soaking time and hot water is required for washing.

 [![Grease stain before using WD-40](https://github.com/naunidhsingh03/ELP305-TribeD-Resources/raw/280fdb451ed940e8a1bfbbd416651b69019e250b/solvent_pictures/wd_40_before.jpg)](https://your-link-here)

Figure 20: Grease stain after using WD-40


### 2.11.6. PCE(perchloroethylene)
  * Pros: Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) is a nonflammable, liquid solvent widely used in dry cleaning and is effective in removing oil and grease stains..In small quantities.
* Cons: Extended exposure to large quantities of PCE could cause irritation to eyes, skin, throat, nose, and respiratory system.

### 2.11.7. Handwash(Dettol)
Tested hand wash to clean oil stain with gentle brushing and it successfully cleaned the oil stain.
* Pros: Handwashes are biodegradable and environmentally friendly and can be washed and reused multiple times. They are soft and less abrasive
* Cons: Depending on the material and color, handwashes may be more prone to staining, which could affect the appearance and cleanliness of cloth

### 2.11.8. Dishwasher (Vim Drop)
* Pros: Effective in removing both oil and grease stains by scrubbing with vim drop and water with normal pressure.

[![Grease stain before using dishwasher(Vim)](https://github.com/naunidhsingh03/ELP305-TribeD-Resources/raw/280fdb451ed940e8a1bfbbd416651b69019e250b/solvent_pictures/dishwash_before.jpg)](https://your-link-here)

Figure 22: Grease stain after using dishwasher(Vim)


### 2.11.9. Trichloroethylene (TCE): chlorinated solvent

* Pros: Stain remover and degreaser. TCE evaporates quickly, leaving behind a dry surface.TCE can act quickly to break down and dissolve stains or contaminants, making it effective for rapid cleaning processes.
* Cons: TCE exposure has been linked to various health risks, including respiratory, neurological, and reproductive effects. Prolonged or repeated exposure can lead to serious health problems, and it is considered a potential human carcinogen. TCE has been restricted or banned in many countries for certain applications. TCE is flammable, posing a fire hazard. Special precautions are needed when handling and storing TCE to prevent accidents. It is also persistent in the environment and can contaminate soil and groundwater, posing risks to ecosystems.

### 2.11.10. Isopropyl(Rubbing alcohol 68-72%)
  * Pros: Isopropyl alcohol, also known as rubbing alcohol, is a natural degreasing agent sold in most department stores. Based on the theoretical searches it was suggested a volatile solvent to remove oil and grease stains
  * Cons: The idea was rejected after practically experimenting on the grease and oil stained cotton cloth by scrubbing and even soaking the cloth in it for 5 min didn't remove oil and Grease stain. May be effective after a longer time of soaking, and thus not efficient because of time constraints.

Figure 23:  Grease stain after applying isopropyl(rubbing alcohol 68-72%)

  

### 2.11.11.  Detergent (Surf Excel)
  * Pros: Was effective on oil stains with slight scrubbing 
  * Cons: The idea was rejected because it was not effective on Grease stain, even after hard scrubbing



![Grease Stain After Using Detergent and Scrubbing](https://github.com/naunidhsingh03/ELP305-TribeD-Resources/raw/280fdb451ed940e8a1bfbbd416651b69019e250b/solvent_pictures/detergent_after.png)
