00:00 Removing Grease Stains Introduction

Today’s video is part of our ever-expanding collection of stain removal guides. If you’re struggling with stains on your clothes caused by grease, then today’s video is the one that you want!

00:50 Understanding Grease Stains

Grease stains come from oily organic and inorganic materials. The most common types are derived from vegetable oil, dairy and animal fats, and industrial lubricants. Most greases are pale or golden yellow in color.

The term “grease” or “greasy” is often colloquially applied to other potential stains. Grease is a water-insoluble lipid, meaning, that it is a fatty, tacky substance that doesn’t dissolve easily in water.

03:52 Stain Removal: First Steps

1. Remove any excess grease
2. Sprinkle desiccants like baking soda, cornstarch, or salt onto the stain
3. Check the cleaning instructions for your garment before putting any cleaning agent on it

05:45 Stains on Cotton, Linen, or Synthetics
08:44 Stains on Wools and Knits
09:32 Stains on Delicates (e.g. Silk)
10:05 Stains on Leather and Suede

For all of the fabric types and sets of instructions previously mentioned, you may need to repeat these steps multiple times. Between each attempt, take a picture of the stain to determine if you’re making progress or not.

If you are dealing with a heavily set-in grease stain, spray the stained area with a water displacement lubricant. If the grease stain still hasn’t gone away, it’s time to take the garment to the dry cleaners for some professional help.

13:06 Conclusion

Stains on your favorite clothes are never fun but with the information you’ve learned today, tackling grease stains should be no issue for you. Let us know in the comments if you have any grease-stain removal tips that we missed.
